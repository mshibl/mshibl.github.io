      <p>
        America is suffering from a shortage of skilled tech workers. I'm not talking here about the shortage of demand for engineers in silicon valley from companies like eBay or facebook, but rather a problem that is facing every part of the country. In fact, more than 60% of the demand is coming from non-tech industries (banking, health care, tourism etc.). These are industries who are trying to take advantage of the technology revolution, but are not finding enough talent to do so.In <a href= "https://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2015/03/09/president-obama-speaks-national-league-cities-conference">a recent speech</a>, president Obama credits America's leadership in innovation and technology to the country's great universities, research, and most importantly great workers, however he sends a warning by saying <I>"If we lose those assets, the jobs will start drifting somewhere else, companies will get started somewhere else, and the great new industries of the future may not be here in America"</I>
      </p>

      <p>
        For the past 100 years, how did America maintain its reputation of having the greatest technology workers? the answer is <b>Immigration</b>. In his new book (Is the American Century Over?) Harvard political scientist Joseph Nye makes an argument that the USA world prominence is far from over, largely because of one ingredient that makes America so unique, which is the USA's openness towards migrants. Nye quotes Lee Kuan Yew (the founding father of modern Singapore) for saying "China can draw on a talent pool of 1.3 billion people, but the U.S. can draw on the worlds' 7 billion". Which brings me to my question, is this still the case? is the USA still the immigrants haven it used to be?
      </p>

      <p>
        Putting my question into context, let me quickly give you an idea on how the US government currently handles the flow of skilled immigrants. Each year, the USA government issues 65,000 work visas, to apply for one of these visas, the foreign worker must find a company that is welling to sponsor him/her. The application window for such visas is usually less than a week long, which means that if you miss your chance to apply during this week, you'll have to wait for the next year. That's not all; last year 233,000 applications were submitted, out of which only 65,000 were approved. The way the US government handles this, is through a <b>lottery!</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Now lets' imagine together how many great minds America is pushing away because of a "lottery". To give you an idea of how immigrants have contributed to the technology revolution in the USA, here are a few companies that were started by immigrants:
        <ul>
          <li>Google - Co-founded by Sergey Brin (immigrant)</li>
          <li>At&t - Founded by Alexander Graham-Bell (immigrant)</li>
          <li>eBay - Founded by Pierre Omidyar (immigrant) </li>
          <li>Yahoo - Founded by Jerry Yang (immigrant)</li>
          <li>Paypal - Co-founded by Elon Musk (immigrant)</li>
        </ul>
        These are just very few samples from the recent history, but going even further back in time, one person comes to mind, which Albert Einstein (Immigrated to the US in 1933). Imagine if Einstein was rejected to work in the USA because of a lottery!
