  <h1>What's your thinking style?</h1>
  <h4>August 16, 2015</h4>

            <p>
                In preparation for joining an 18 month program to learn programming, I was asked to take a personality test that would evaluate my "style of
thinking". This test is called the <b>(Mind Styles Model)</b> invented by Anthony F. Gregorc, Ph. D., who is a                <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Phenomenography.htm">phenomenological</a> (I have no idea what that word means!), he also
                happens to be a researcher, lecturer, consultant, author and President of Gregorc Associates, Inc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Basically, the mind styles model splits a person's style of thinking into 2 parts:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>The first part is your <b>Perceptual Quality</b> which is the way you interpret information, do you accept the obvious meaning "Concrete thinking", or do you often think that it might a have a hidden meaning "Abstract thinking".
            </li>
            <li>The second part is your <b>Ordering Ability</b> which is basically the way your mind organizes information, and how you complete any given task. Do you like following a plan "Sequential thinking" or do you prefer to follow your impulses "Random thinking"
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After taking the test myself, I was given the analysis that I have an "Abstract Sequential" way of thinking. The main highlights are that I
                like to take the time to analyze information before acting on it, I prefer to have the ability to work alone, and I don't like being limited by
                too many rules and regulations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assuming that all of this analysis is true, I started looking back at my first 3 weeks studying at Dev Bootcamp. How am I dealing with this
                learning experience? Is there anything that I could improve? Is there anything I'm already improving? The truth is that my biggest struggle is
                the pairing sessions (my tendency to work alone), where I have to work with someone on solving a given set of challenges. The reason I find
                pairing up difficult is that most of the time I feel it would be easier to just go through the problem alone. However, I started realizing that
                there's one advantage in particular in pairing up at Dev Bootcamp, which is getting feedback. In a real life work environment, you will be
                required to work with other people, but most likely, you will not receive much feedback. I'm starting to see that getting actionable feedback
                can greatly help me build up my skills and fix my flaws before I head out of Dev Bootcamp looking for a job!

                Having said all of this, I have to say that I'm not a big fan of personality quizzes. I believe that self perception and reality can be 2
                entirely different things, this is why most of the personality quizzes gives you an analysis of (how you think you are) instead of (who you
                really are). Why don't you give it a try? <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Here is the link to the quiz</a>!
