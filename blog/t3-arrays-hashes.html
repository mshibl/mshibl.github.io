  <h1>Array or Hash? what's it gonna be?</h1>
  <h4>August 16, 2015</h4>

<p>So there are arrays and there are hashes. Sound familiar? Probably not. The truth is it's really very simple and it's really very very important! </p>

<b>What are arrays?</b>

<p>An array is a set of objects grouped together. These objects can all be of the same type (ex. An array of numbers) or they can be a mix of different types (ex. An array of numbers and symbols). In simple words you can imagine an array as a container that you can store your stuff in, with every item having a numbered label on it, if you know the number you can easily find the item. You can also name the entire container (ex. My_old_photos_container).</p>

<p>An array looks like this [object_1,object_2,object_3,……..]. The first object in the array has the number/label 0, the second item has the number/label 2 and so on. </p>

<p>You see, that wasn't so difficult. Now you're ready to know the secret of what makes arrays so special. Once you have objects grouped together,  you have power to manipulate these objects in many ways. You can transform objects altogether or one by one, you can call an object by its index number, you can remove/add objects, and much much more.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about arrays, I recommend the following <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<b>What is a Hash?</b>

<p>A hash is very similar to an array, except that instead of an index number each item in a hash can have a (key). A Key can be anything, it can be a number, a word, a symbol, etc. This way a hash is set of (key/value) pairs. Just like an array, Hashes can be manipulated in many ways, allowing you to control the complete set altogether.</p>

<p>Hashes are very useful, one example is having a record of names as keys and driving license numbers as values, using such hash table, you can search for a person's name (key) and you'll immediate get his/her license number. Now think bigger, what if we have an array stored as the value, this array can hold a lot of data about a certain person, by calling this person's name, you can immediately get his entire data (of course you have to store this data first).</p>

<p>Hash tables look like this:
{ Key_1: value_1
Key_2: value_2
………
………
}</p>
