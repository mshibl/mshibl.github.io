    <p>As part of Dev Bootcamp's week-1 preparation, we were asked to watch a  <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">video by Shereef Bishay</a> (Dev Bootcamp's Founder). In this video Shereef explains the type of mentality that he is hoping all Dev Bootcamp students should have in order to succeed in this 18-week journey. As per Shereef, there are 2 ways to look at this:
      <ol type="1">
        <li><b>The Customer Mentality:</b> As a customer in a restaurant, you look at the menu, order a dish of your choice, you eat, pay the check and leave. You expect to get your order spot on, perfectly cooked. Otherwise you give the restaurant a bad review, and never return again. What if you apply the same mentality to Dev Bootcamp, going in expecting to pay the price tag, expecting everything to be perfectly organized and the curriculum to be flawless. You expect to find a job soon after you graduate. Otherwise, bad review?</li><br>
        <li><b>The Chef Mentality:</b> As a chef, you go into the kitchen, you expect to find all ingredients and tools that you need, you start experimenting, you know that it will soon get messy, you expect that you'll fail several times, before you get that perfect dish exactly like you imagined it! Now again, try thinking about this same mentality at Dev Bootcamp, where you go in, you have great help and support, you have a good curriculum (not nearly perfect). You start learning step by step, you expect to fail, you know that you will not always find things exactly as you want the, but you're welling to go out and find answers.</li>
      </ol>
    It's obvious that Shereef is pushing towards the (Chef Mentality). This is how he concludes it: "This is all just one big experiment, in many ways you are guinea pigs, and hopefully you also become mad scientists in the process".
    </p>

    <p>The truth is, to take full advantage of a program like Dev Bootcamp, you should absolutely put aside the (customer mentality) and wear the chefs’ hat.<br>
    Coding Bootcamps are designed to prepare you to find a full time job as a developer, in a real job you will not find fancy step by step guides for every task assigned to you. Other people might give you advice but that surely has a limit as well, you’re simply required to figure out how to get the work done, it’s what you’re getting paid for!
    Now think about it, instead of feeding you some information, and then giving you a test with a grade than no one will ever care about (including yourself). What if, you’re taught how to (self learn), how to experiment and search for answers, and how to deal with situations where you’re required to accomplish a task without knowing how it’s done.
    </p>
    <p>It’s obvious that wearing the chefs’ hat will not be easy. Getting rid of the customer mentality is much easier said than done. After all you did pay a hefty price tag for this program!
    So will you be a customer ... or a chef?
