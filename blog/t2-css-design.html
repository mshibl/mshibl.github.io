    A webpage is very similar to a normal building. This is an analogy that helped me understand the basics of web design. A building has an inner structure (lobby, rooms, hallways etc.), in the case of a webpage the inner structure is the <b>HTML</b>, the rooms are the different elements that makeup an HTML document (header, body, footer etc.). Once a building structure is in place, the decoration then takes place (wall paint, curtains, floorings etc.), in the case of a webpage the decoration is done using <b>CSS</b>, using CSS you can add the background colors, you can choose the type & size of the font , you can position different elements and much more!

    Learning CSS is easy, the syntax is easy to grasp and the tools to learn is readily available to anyone. However, one of the CSS concepts that many beginners find confusing is <b>Positioning</b>. Personally, it took me a long time to quite understand how to appropriately position different elements within a webpage using the <b><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_position.asp">Position Property</a></b>, the reason is that you can easily get tricked that everything in your page is positioned correctly, until something goes wrong (for example an image is not where it is supposed to be), then you start tracing back through your code, making changes on the go, eventually things get messy!

    Lets take a look at the different values that can be assigned to the position property:
      <ul>
        <li>Static (Default Value): The elements is positioned (rendered) in the same order as in the HTML code.</li>
        <li>Absolute: The element is positioned relative to its first un-statically positioned parent (container) element. Otherwise, the element is positioned relative to the browser window.</li>
        <li>Fixed: The element is positioned relative to the browser window. It remains in the same position even if the page is scrolled up or down.</li>
        <li>Relative: The element is positioned relative to its own normal position. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    There are 4 other important properties that assist in the positioning of an element on a page. These are (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_top.asp">top</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_bottom.asp">bottom</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_right.asp">right</a> & <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_left.asp">left</a>). The way those 4 properties behave is dependent on the value of the position property.</p>

    <p>
    Generally speaking, the way you control the position of an element on a page is through a combination of the property value along with one or more of the 4 properties mentioned above.

    Now before you start going crazy with CSS, go through the examples below, and all of this will start making sense.
