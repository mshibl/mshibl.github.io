    <h3>GitHub</h3>
    <p>
        Quick Fact: GitHub has a community of more than 10 million people!<br>

    <h4>Version Control</h4>
    <p>
        At it's core Git is a Version Control System. So what does Version Control mean?<br>
        Version Control is a method that allows you to create a new version every time you modify your code (instead of overwriting the copy you're currently working on). GitHub uses version control to allow more than one programmer to work on the same piece of code without overwriting each other. It makes sure that whenever a piece of the code is modified by any contributor, a new version of the whole code is created, it also shows which part of the code was modified and by whom.
